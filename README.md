Task provided by [jaktestowac.pl](link)

This is a collection of my solutions to the course tasks with some notes in theory section.

## Prerequirements

You need to have `node` preinstalled (tested on <version>)

## How to run

1. Execute `npm install` in the project direcory to install required node packages.
2. You can use scripts to run selected file, eg. `npm run ts1e1` will run the 1st example in the 1st theory section, `npm run es1e1` will run the 1st exercise. See `package.json` for more details./code.visualstudio.com/)
